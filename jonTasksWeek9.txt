Jon's week 9 stuff:  

* Adjusted size of player's climbing collider so it will not get stuck on ceilings.

* Added missing boolean value to Panther animation controller to stop Unity from fussing.

* Camera script reconfigured to have an x-offset that adds to the margins and target camera postion based on which direction the player is facing.

The camera pans to the target position with different speed depending on how far away the camera position is from the target position. This makes for a nice, comfy effect. :)

* Allowed walking on a sloped surface by lowering friction of the ground from 1 to 0.4, which allows thing to move uphill. Also moved groundCheck child to be in a slightly different position to better detect the ground under slopes.

New problem introduced: SLIDING BACK DOWN THE DARN SLOPE.
* Resolved by freezing a player's motion in X-axis entirely when grounded.

New problem 2 introduced: FREEZING X AXIS PREVENTS KNOCKBACK
* Knockback was drastically reworked in the playerHealth script to add a velocity up and away from whatever caused damage. Player motion control also had to be disabled during this. It works better now.
