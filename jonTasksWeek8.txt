Jon:  
Lots of debugging this week!

* Implemented a rough climbing system for when the player character jumps into the wall. The player can move up or down slowly with the w/s keys. (Still needs animation.)
* Removed dynamic collider sizes that matched animations. It was a cute idea to have the side of the player's sprite set the hitbox, but caused too many jumpy issues.
* Set a speed limit on the character motion to double their usual maximum speed. This should stop things from occasionally going flying during a collision.
* Reworked sword swings to make sure the previous swing finishes before starting the next, this fixes triggering so multiple hits register correctly.
* Added an additional animator boolean so things like sword-swings that can occur at any time will no longer occur while character is dead
